# Vector Plot
There is a vizualise version to understand what diffarential equations want to do actually.
**Python**,in particular *matplotlib* gives a amazing slope plot named `quiver`. Where we plot a little vector for every points.
The first defination of diffarentiation is enough for this kind of plot.
# Desclaimer 
As far as I understand this kind of vizualisation only valid for 1st order diffarential equations.
